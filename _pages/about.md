About Me
======

Welcome to my website!

My name is Xinyi ZHOU (pronounced Shin-yee Joe). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at [HKUST Business School](https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Lijian LU](https://lijianlu.people.ust.hk/). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Ruxian WANG](https://sites.google.com/view/ruxianwang) throughout my Ph.D. journey.
Before joining HKUST, I received my B.Sc. in Physics from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) in 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Zhengxin LIU](http://www.phys.ruc.edu.cn/info/1182/1541.htm).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

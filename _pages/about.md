About Me
======

Welcome to my website!

My name is Xinyi ZHOU (pronounced Shin-yee Joe; you can also call me Josey). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at [HKUST Business School](https://bm.hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Lijian LU](https://lijianlu.people.ust.hk/).

Before joining HKUST, I received my B.Sc. in Physics from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/) in 2021, where I was advised by [Prof. Zhengxin LIU](http://www.phys.ruc.edu.cn/info/1182/1541.htm).

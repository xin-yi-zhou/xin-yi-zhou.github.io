Xiaomi
======
I have the cutest cat named Xiaomi, who has been with me for 14 years since my primary school, and I look forward to another 14 years together.

Badminton
======
I enjoy playing badminton with my friends in my leisure time. Representing the mainland student team of HKUST, we won the championship in the Hong Kongâ€“Shenzhen University Student Badminton Exchange Competition and finished as runner-up in the Hong Kong Six Universities Badminton League.

I have the cutest cat named Xiaomi, who has been with me for 14 years since my primary school, and I look forward to another 14 years together.

<h1 id="badminton">Badminton</h1>
I enjoy playing badminton with my friends in my leisure time. Representing the mainland student team of HKUST, we won the championship in the Hong Kongâ€“Shenzhen University Student Badminton Exchange Competition and finished as runner-up in the Hong Kong Six Universities Badminton League.
